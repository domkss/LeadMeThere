# Lead Me There

**Lost in the world? Tired of playing "Find the Friend" instead of the actual game?**  
If you’ve ever taken a wrong turn to **1035, 45, 17** instead of **-1034, 45, 17** this mod is made just for you!
<br />Available on <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/lead-me-there">Modrinth</a> and <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lead-me-there">CurseForge</a>

### <br/>Features:
- Shows a **HUD indicator** when you're facing the right direction toward your selected friend.
- Highlights your friend with a **glowing box** visible even through walls — no more endless searching!
- No more asking for coordinates every 5 minutes.

Stay together, avoid getting lost, and spend more time adventuring — not navigating.
